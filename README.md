# Sonos smart speaker controller API and CLI

This project implements (most of) the Sonos control API
in a rust crate.  It also provides a simple command-line tool which
can be used in scripts.

You likely need a recent rust compiler.

Build with "cargo build".

See src/main.rs for an example on how to use the API.
